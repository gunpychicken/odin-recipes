        <h2>A Classic and Easy Breakfast Meal</h2>
        <p>A breakfast skillet is hearty and simple, and allows the addition of any available ingredients on hand. It only takes about a half an hour to prepare, and can also be an easy solution to meal-prepping.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8-10 slices bacon, chopped</li>
            <li>8 breakfast sausage links</li>
            <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>2 large potatoes, peeled and diced</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>one fourth teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
            <li>6 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, or favorite cheese</li>
            <li>2 green onions, chopped (garnish)</li>
            <li>salsa (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Add sausage links to a 12’’ skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until browned and cooked through. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Add bacon to the pan and cook until crisp, stirring occasionally. Remove bacon to the plate, leaving 3-4 Tablespoons grease in the pan (add a little oil or butter if there's not enough grease).</li>
                <li>Add potatoes to the pan in a single layer and season well with salt and pepper. Cook, flipping only occasionally, until crisp on all sides, and fork tender (around 8-10 minutes, or less if using frozen diced hash browns). Push potatoes off to the side of the pan and add onion, bell pepper and garlic. Sauté for about 3 more minutes.</li>
                <li>Chop the sausage into bite sized pieces and add both sausage and bacon back to the pan. Sprinkle with smoked paprika.</li>
                <li>Use a wooden spoon to make 6 wells in the pan to crack eggs in to. Crack the eggs into each well and sprinkle them with a little salt and pepper. Sprinkle shredded cheese evenly over everything.</li>
                <li>
                    Cover pan with a lid and cook over low heat for a few minutes until egg whites are set and cheese is melted. Garnish with green onion and serve with red or green salsa and hot sauce.</li>
            </ol>
