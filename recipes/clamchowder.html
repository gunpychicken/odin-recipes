        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>How to Boil Clams</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add about 3 cups of water to a large pot, then add clam, cover, and place over high heat. Cook clams for about 5 minutes. Uncover the pot, stir the clams, and continue cooking for another 3-4 minutes or until they open up.</li>
                    <li>Turn off the heat and discard any clams that didn't open. Strain the liquid from the pot through a mesh strainer lined with a coffee filter and reserve it for later. Coarsely chop the clams and set them aside.</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>How to Make Clam Chowder</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large pot over medium heat, cook bacon until crispy. Drain it on paper towels while leaving 1-2 tablespoons of bacon drippings in the pot.</li>
                    <li>Next, melt the butter, follow with the onions and celery, and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, thyme, bay leaf, Creole seasoning, and flour, and cook for about a minute or until the garlic is fragrant and the flour turns pale golden.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the reserved clam broth, cream, and half-and-half while whisking constantly until combined. Stir in the potatoes and bring the mixture to a boil. Then reduce heat and simmer until the potatoes are tender (about 10 minutes).</li>
                    <li>Add the chopped clams and cook until heated through (about 2 minutes)—adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste. If the chowder is too thick, gradually stir in more half-and-half or clam juice until you reach your preferred consistency.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with chopped bacon and chives, and serve immediately with crusty bread or cornbread.</li>
                </ol>
